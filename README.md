# iptables

iptables is a command-line firewall utility that uses policy chains to allow or block traffic. When a connection tries to establish itself on your system, iptables looks for a rule in its list to match it to. If it doesn't find one, it resorts to the default action.
iptables almost always comes pre-installed on any Linux distribution
